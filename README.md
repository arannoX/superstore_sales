# Superstore Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing the Superstore Sales Data to segment customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics. The analysis aims to understand customer behavior and categorize them accordingly.

## Files
- `superstore_sales_data.csv`: The raw sales data file.
- `create_database_and_tables.sql`: This SQL script will create the database and tables.
- `data_cleaning_eda.sql`: Data checks and preprocessing steps.
- `rfm_segmentation.sql`: SQL script for performing RFM segmentation.

**Note:** The database management system used is MySQL. Data was imported using the Data Import Wizard tool.

## Methodology
1. **Data Verification:** Ensuring data integrity and consistency.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing product counts, sales trends, and customer behavior.
4. **RFM Segmentation:** Classifying customers based on their purchasing behavior.

## Findings/Results
- Identified key customer segments based on RFM scores.
- Determined high-value customers and their purchasing patterns.
- Provided insights into customer retention and potential marketing strategies.

## Tools & Technologies
- MySQL for database management.
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data analysis and visualization.
- SQL for querying and data manipulation.

## Conclusion
This analysis helps businesses make data-driven decisions for marketing strategies, customer retention, and revenue growth.

## Future Work
- Implementing machine learning models for predictive analytics.
- Automating data ingestion and preprocessing.
- Expanding analysis to include seasonality and trend forecasting.
